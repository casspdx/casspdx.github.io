    Website I like: <a href="https://2022.jokula.is/"> RIGHT HERE </a>
    I like this website because the movement makes it interesting to look at and creates a mysterious aura. 
    The eye on the website sticks out to me the most.

    My project 1 is partially inspired by this design found on Pinterest

    I liked the simplistc style and neutral colors. The rectangles also serve as a "menu" for the 4 different pages. I am really passionate 
    about makeup and I thought it would be interesting to base my website off that.

    I really enjoyed this website because of the beautiful typography & imagery. All images have animation as well which spices up the site and makes it more interesting.
